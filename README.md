# GapMinder-EnergyPrediction

Do you know the GAPMINDER FOUNDATION project? 
If the answer is no, you need to take a look at it at https://www.gapminder.org/ Gapminder's stated mission is 'Fighting devastating ignorance with fact-based worldviews everyone can understand. In their website they share huge amount of data, from all fields (population, health, education, salaries, energy production/consumption...) from almost all the regions of the world and group by years.

In this project, the objective is to determine with machine learning techniques, a prediction of an unregistered data, based on correlations of differents variables.

  Predictive data: Life expectancy, population, population density, population growth and urban growth
  Target: Energy/person ratio
  
  Machine Learning Model: Multiple LinnearRegresion
  
  Coding Language: R
  
  
Data obtained thru the GapMinder Foundation website. [https://www.gapminder.org/data/]
I want to thank my teachers and classmates from The Bridge for helping me doing this project, that started as past of the DATASCIENCE bootcamp, and I am currently ending it during the month of September 2020.
